# rox

This project is a dynamic scripting language interpreter built from scratch in Rust. It utilizes a hand-written recursive descent parser and a tree-walk evaluator.

It demonstrates advanced Rust patterns, including ownership-safe environment sharing for closures, result-based error propagation, and efficient memory reuse during string operations.

### Key Features:

-  **Strict Type Safety:** Adopting a 'Rust-like' strong typing system.

-  **Lexical Scoping:** Implements full closure support.

-  **Rich Data Types:** Built-in support for Scalars, Strings, Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries.

-  **Control Flow:** Comprehensive support for loops, branching, and jump statements.
